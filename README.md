# Intro

What started as a simple timer app, grew into a personal challenge to build a multifunctional app based on the principles of clean code and object oriented programming.

This project enabled me to significantly improve my JavaScript and general programming skillset. I was having fun and becoming obsessed with refactoring the app in a way that makes the code more efficient, scalable and readable. As a personal challenge, I decided to use the same DOM elements for all 3 apps that are contained within this app, with the option of each app working with difeerent elements/different number of elements, and being able to work as an individual app. With OPP and ES6 class syntax I primarily focused on writing reusable methods and creating an easily scalable app. Refactors resulted in separation of concerns in the logic and simpler to understand functions. I also watched the clean code series from Robert C. Martin (aka. "Uncle Bob"; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EmboKQH8lM&ab_channel=UnityCoin) and implemented the principles taught in the lectures. At the end of the project I added responsive design.

## Directories

Directory named "FINAL CODE - ..." contains the final product of my work. It contains it's own README.md file.

Other directories contain previous refactors of the code, in a easily accessible way.
