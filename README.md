# Intro

What started as a simple timer app, grew into a personal challenge to build a multifunctional app based on the principles of clean code and object oriented programming.

This project enabled me to significantly improve my JavaScript and general programming skillset. I was having fun and becoming obsessed with refactoring the app in a way that makes the code more efficient, scalable and readable. With OPP and ES6 class syntax I primarily focused on writing reusable methods and creating an easily scalable app. Refactors resulted in separation of concerns in the logic and simpler to understand functions. At the end of the project I implemented responsive design principles.

## Directories

Directory named "FINAL CODE - ..." contains the final product of my work. It contains it's own README.md file.

Other directories contain previous refactors of the code, in a easily accessible way.
